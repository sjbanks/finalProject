final project for data structures - Emergency Room Wait List app

Use the GUI to enter patient information that stores them in a queue. Each field must be filled with information.

There is a submit button that adds the new patient to the wait list.

Auto Add puts 10 pre-created patients in the wait list

The sort by last name and sort by age buttons use an insertion sort to return the wait list sorted by Last Name from A-Z or by Age from youngest to oldest. 

Show insured shows only those patients that have health insurance

Remove takes a patient off the wait list and displays that they've seen a doctor

Show waitlist will print the details of all the patients curretly on the wait list

Wait time will estimate how long the wait list will take to get through, based on how many patients are currenlty waiting
